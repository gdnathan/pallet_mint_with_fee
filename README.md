The pallet adds functionality to mint a value on an account, and to optionally mint a percentage of this value on another account (as a fee).
It also provides an extrinsic to change the percentage value.

The calls have to be from Root, so as a Democracy proposal, or as a sudo call.

This pallet was originally made for the [Kabocha Network parachain](https://github.com/kabocha-network), with the support of [Decentration](https://github.com/decentration) and [tdelabro](https://github.com/tdelabro)
